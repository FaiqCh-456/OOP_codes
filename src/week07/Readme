The provided Java program demonstrates exception handling with two main focus areas:

Division Handling (Divider Class)

Takes two integers as input and attempts to divide them.
Catches and handles ArithmeticException (e.g., division by zero).
Array Access Handling (ArrayHandler Class)

Attempts to access the 5th element of a 4-element array.
Catches and handles ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
Program Flow (Demo and Driver Classes)
Demo Class:

Reads two integers from the user.
Calls Divider.ArithmeticException() for division.
Calls ArrayHandler.Array() to access the array.
Driver Class:

Combines division and array access in a single try-catch-finally block.
Handles both ArithmeticException and ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
Sample Output

Welcome my friend 
5
0
enter two numbers to divide
Arithmetic Exception
array at index 4
Array index out of bound error
In finally block
