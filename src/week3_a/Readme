Java Project: Product and Geometry Management

Project Overview

This Java project is a collection of classes designed to manage products and perform basic geometric operations. The project demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming concepts like encapsulation, method overloading, and static blocks.

Project Structure

Packages

week3_a: Contains all Java classes for this project.

Classes

Date

Handles date-related information (day, month, year).

Methods:

Getters and setters for day, month, year.

toString() for date formatting.

getRecentDate(Date d1, Date d2) to compare two dates.

Product

Represents a product with attributes like name, ID, price, manufacturing date, and quantity.

Features:

Static counter for auto-generating product IDs.

Static and instance initializer blocks for demonstrating execution order.

getLatest(Product p1, Product p2) to find the most recently manufactured product.

Rectangle

Models a rectangle with basic operations.

Methods:

calcArea() to calculate the area.

calCircumference() to calculate the circumference.

Rectangle1

An advanced rectangle class with position coordinates (x, y).

Methods:

area() and circumference() calculations.

min(Rectangle1 r1, Rectangle1 r2) to compare two rectangles by area.

overlap(Rectangle1 r1, Rectangle1 r2) to check if two rectangles overlap.

Demo

Demonstrates the functionality of the Rectangle class.

Prints the area and circumference of a rectangle.

Driver

Tests the Rectangle1 class.

Calculates area, circumference, and checks for overlap between two rectangles.

ProductTest

Demonstrates the functionality of the Product and Date classes.

Compares products based on manufacturing dates.
