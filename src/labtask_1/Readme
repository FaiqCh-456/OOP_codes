Music and Singer Management System
Project Overview
The Music and Singer Management System is a Java application that models a basic relationship between music tracks and their respective singers. 
The program includes features to manage the details of music tracks, their release dates, and the associated singer's details, including debut year.

Features
Music Management:

Stores details like title, duration, genre, release date, and associated singer.
Overrides toString to provide a detailed string representation of a music object.
Includes a custom equals method to compare music tracks by title.
Singer Management:

Stores details like name, gender, nationality, and debut year.
Overrides toString for a clean string representation of a singer object.
Date Management:

Manages day, month, and year details.
Provides getters and setters for manipulation.
Overrides toString to format dates as day/month/year.
Error Handling:

Ensures proper initialization and prevents direct misuse of object attributes.
Object Relationships:

Demonstrates the relationship between a Music track and its corresponding Singer.

Example Usage
Creating Music and Singer Objects

Music m1 = new Music("Nahi milta", "2:45", "sufi", new Date(1, 4, 2021), 
                     new Singer("Bayan", "Male", "Pakistani", new Date(13, 2, 2008)));
System.out.println(m1);

Music m2 = new Music("Mil jata hae", "2:45", "pqr", new Date(1, 4, 2021), 
                     new Singer("XYZ", "Male", "Indian", new Date(13, 2, 2003)));
System.out.println(m2);
Comparing Music Tracks

System.out.println(m1.equals(m2)); // Compares the title of both music tracks
Output Example

Nahi milta/2:45/sufi/1/4/2021/Bayan/Male/Pakistani/13/2/2008
Mil jata hae/2:45/pqr/1/4/2021/XYZ/Male/Indian/13/2/2003
false
